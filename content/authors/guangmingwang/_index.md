I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate of the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge advised by Prof. Brian Sheil..

I obtain my Ph.D. degree in the Intelligent Robotics and Machine Vision (IRMV) Lab at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University advised by Prof. Hesheng Wang.

From 2021.09, I also work with Prof. Masayoshi Tomizuka from UC Berkeley. From 2022.06 to 2023.06, I was a visiting researcher in the Computer Vision and Geometry Group (CVG), ETH Zurich, advised by Prof. Marc Pollefeys.

I am an Associate Editor (AE) for RAL, ICRA2024, 2025, and IROS2024, 2025. I was awarded the DAAD AI and Robotics fellow. I obtained twice “Scholarships for Doctoral Students” (Top 1% in Shanghai Jiao Tong University). My doctoral thesis received the Excellent Doctoral Dissertation Award from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (15 recipients university-wide annually, the only one in Department of Automation)!

Most of my co-mentored undergraduates have gone to UC Berkeley, Princeton, HKU, Columbia, Gatech, UCSD, UCLA, TUM, SJTU and so on. Some of them got full scholarships for direct PhD students. Welcome to contact me to come to the University of Cambridge for a visiting PhD student or remote collaboration!
